wp-delete-original-image
========================

Delete Original Image is a Wordpress plugin to delete the the original image file uploaded and replace the original file with one of the WordPress image sizes. It will copy all the metadata and the file name from your original image to the new image, and delete the original giant image so it doesn't take up space. You can select which image size you want to use as your replacement on the settings page.

The plugin gives you an option to enable/disable this to be done automatically when you upload an image. And/or you can do it in bulk for all your previously uploaded images.
